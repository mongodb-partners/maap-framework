## 2. System Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](assets/cohere/arch_diagram.png)

The MAAP architecture consists of several microservices that communicate with each other to process user queries and generate responses:

1. **UI Service**: Provides the web interface for user interaction (Port 8501)
7. **MongoDB Atlas**: Provides vector search and storage capabilities (Ports 27015 to 27017 (TCP))

All services are containerized using Docker and can be deployed together using Docker Compose.

## 3. Components

### 3.1 UI Service

The UI Service provides a web-based interface for users to interact with the MAAP system. Built with streamlit it offers:

- A chat interface for sending queries and receiving responses

Key files:
- `app.py`: Contains the streamlit application.
- `backend.py`: The functions and business logic for the application.

### 3.2 MongoDB Management Scripts

Several utility scripts are provided for managing MongoDB Atlas clusters and creating vector indexes:

- `mongodb_cluster_manager.ksh`: Manages MongoDB Atlas cluster deployment
- `mongodb_atlas_cli.py`: Python CLI for MongoDB Atlas operations

### Script Structure

The script is organized into several main functions:

1. `create_key()`: Creates or uses an existing EC2 key pair
2. `deploy_infra()`: Deploys the base infrastructure using CloudFormation
3. `deploy_ec2()`: Deploys the EC2 instance and application stack
4. `read_logs()`: Streams deployment logs from the EC2 instance
5. Main execution flow

### Configuration

#### Environment Variables

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: AWS access key
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: AWS secret key
- `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`: AWS session token (if using temporary credentials)

#### Deployment Parameters

- `INFRA_STACK_NAME`: Name for the infrastructure CloudFormation stack
- `EC2_STACK_NAME`: Name for the EC2 CloudFormation stack
- `AWS_REGION`: AWS region for deployment
- `EC2_INSTANCE_TYPE`: EC2 instance type (e.g., "t3.xlarge")
- `VolumeSize`: EBS volume size in GB
- `GIT_REPO_URL`: URL of the application Git repository
- `MongoDBClusterName`: Name for the MongoDB Atlas cluster
- `MongoDBUserName`: MongoDB Atlas username
- `MongoDBPassword`: MongoDB Atlas password
- `APIPUBLICKEY`: MongoDB Atlas API public key
- `APIPRIVATEKEY`: MongoDB Atlas API private key

### Execution Flow

1. Initialize logging
2. Create or use existing EC2 key pair
3. Deploy infrastructure CloudFormation stack
4. Retrieve and store infrastructure stack outputs
5. Deploy EC2 instance and application CloudFormation stack
6. Start streaming EC2 deployment logs
7. Monitor application URL until it becomes available
8. Launch application URL in default browser

### Functions

#### create_key()

Creates a new EC2 key pair or uses an existing one with the name "MAAPCohereKeyV1".

#### deploy_infra()

Deploys the base infrastructure CloudFormation stack, including VPC, subnet, security group, and IAM roles.

#### deploy_ec2()

Deploys the EC2 instance and application stack using a CloudFormation template. It includes the following steps:
- Selects the appropriate AMI ID based on the AWS region
- Creates the CloudFormation stack with necessary parameters
- Waits for stack creation to complete
- Retrieves and displays stack outputs

#### read_logs()

Establishes an SSH connection to the EC2 instance and streams the deployment logs in real-time.

### Logging

- Main deployment logs: `./logs/one-click-deployment.log`
- EC2 live logs: `./logs/ec2-live-logs.log`

### Error Handling

The script includes basic error checking for critical operations such as CloudFormation stack deployments. If an error occurs, the script will log the error and exit.

### Security Considerations

- AWS credentials are expected to be set as environment variables
- MongoDB Atlas credentials and API keys are passed as CloudFormation parameters

### Customization

To customize the deployment:
1. Modify the CloudFormation template files (`deploy-infra.yaml` and `deploy-ec2.yaml`)
2. Adjust the deployment parameters at the beginning of the script
3. Update the AMI IDs in the `ami_map` if newer AMIs are available

### Troubleshooting

- Check the log files for detailed information on the deployment process
- Ensure all required environment variables and parameters are correctly set
- Verify AWS CLI configuration and permissions
- Check CloudFormation stack events in the AWS Console for detailed error messages

### Limitations

- The script is designed for a specific application stack and may require modifications for other use cases
- It assumes a certain MongoDB Atlas and AWS account setup
- The script does not include rollback mechanisms for partial deployments. In case of partial failures, delete the related CloudFormation stacks from AWS Console.


### Deployment Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd maap-cohere-qs
   ```

2. Configure the `one-click.ksh` script:
   Open the script in a text editor and fill in the required values for various environment variables:
   - AWS Auth: Specify the `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` for deployment.
   - EC2 Instance Types: Choose suitable instance types for your workload.
   - Network Configuration: Update key names, subnet IDs, security group IDs, etc.
   - Authentication Keys: Fetch Project ID, API public and private keys for MongoDB Atlas Cluster setup. Update the script file with the keys for `APIPUBLICKEY`, `APIPRIVATEKEY`, `GROUPID` suitably.

3. Deploy the application:
   ```
   chmod +x one-click.ksh
   ./one-click.ksh
   ```

4. Access the application at `http://<ec2-instance-ip>:8501`

## 7. Security Considerations

To enhance the security of your AWS EC2 instances and MongoDB Atlas integration, consider the following configurations and best practices:

### Network and Firewall Configuration

#### **MongoDB Atlas:**
- **IP Access List:**
  - Restrict client connections to your Atlas clusters by configuring IP access lists.
  - Add the public IP addresses of your application environments to the IP access list to permit access.
  - For enhanced security, consider using VPC peering or private endpoints to allow private IP addresses.
  - [Configure IP Access List Entries](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security/ip-access-list/).

- **Ports 27015 to 27017 (TCP):**
  - Ensure that your firewall allows outbound connections from your application environment to Atlas on ports **27015 to 27017** for TCP traffic.
  - This configuration enables your applications to access databases hosted on Atlas.

---

### Authentication and Authorization

- **Database Users:**
  - Atlas mandates client authentication to access clusters.
  - Create database users with appropriate roles to control access.
  - [Configure Database Users](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security/config-db-auth/).

- **Custom Roles:**
  - If default roles don't meet your requirements, define custom roles with specific privileges.
  - [Create Custom Roles](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security/config-db-auth/#custom-database-roles).

- **AWS IAM Integration:**
  - Authenticate applications running on AWS services to Atlas clusters using AWS IAM roles.
  - Set up database users to use AWS IAM role ARNs for authentication.
  - [AWS IAM Authentication](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security/config-db-auth/#authentication-with-aws-iam).

---

### Data Encryption

- **Encryption at Rest:**
  - Atlas encrypts all data stored on your clusters by default.
  - For enhanced security, consider using your own key management system.
  - [Encryption at Rest](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security/encryption-at-rest/).

- **TLS/SSL Encryption:**
  - Atlas requires TLS encryption for client connections and intra-cluster communications.
  - Ensure your applications support TLS 1.2 or higher.
  - [TLS/SSL Configuration](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security/tls-ssl/).

---

### Network Peering and Private Endpoints

- **VPC Peering:**
  - Establish VPC peering between your AWS VPC and MongoDB Atlas's VPC to eliminate public internet exposure.
  - [Set Up a Network Peering Connection](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security/vpc-peering/).

- **Private Endpoints:**
  - Use AWS PrivateLink to create private endpoints for secure communication within AWS networks.
  - [Configure Private Endpoints](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security-cluster-private-endpoint/).

- **NAT Gateway:**
  - Use NAT Gateways to route traffic from private subnets while preventing direct internet access to EC2 instances.  

- **Specific IP Ranges:**
  - AWS services like Bedrock use dynamic IPs. Filter these from [AWS IP Ranges](https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json) for egress traffic.  
---

### Compliance and Monitoring

- **Audit Logging:**
  - Enable audit logging to monitor database activities and ensure compliance with data protection regulations.
  - [Enable Audit Logging](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security/audit-logging/).

- **Regular Updates:**
  - Keep your dependencies and Docker images up to date to address security vulnerabilities.

By implementing these configurations and best practices, you can enhance the security, efficiency, and compliance of your integration between AWS resources and MongoDB Atlas.
