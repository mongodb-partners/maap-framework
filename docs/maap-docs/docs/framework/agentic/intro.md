# Framework Overview

[![ReadMe Card](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=mongodb-partners&repo=maap-agentic-framework)](https://github.com/mongodb-partners/maap-agentic-framework)

## Introduction
The MAAP (MongoDB AI Applications Program) Agentic Framework represents a significant advancement in AI application development, extending beyond traditional RAG systems to create truly intelligent, autonomous applications. At its core, this framework combines sophisticated agent architectures with MongoDB's powerful database capabilities, enabling applications that can reason, learn, and execute complex tasks with contextual awareness.

## Architecture and Core Components

The framework is built around a modular architecture that emphasizes flexibility and extensibility. At its heart lies a powerful agent system that combines several key components working in harmony:

### Agent Builder
The Agent Builder serves as the foundation for creating and customizing intelligent agents. It provides a structured approach to defining agent behaviors, capabilities, and interaction patterns. Key features include:
- A declarative configuration system using YAML for agent definition
- Flexible component integration for custom agent capabilities
- Built-in templates for common agent patterns
- Dynamic runtime behavior modification

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server
The MCP Server acts as the central nervous system of the framework, managing communication and context flow between components. It provides:
- Standardized protocol for model-agent interactions
- Real-time context management and routing
- Efficient message handling and prioritization
- Built-in support for multiple model providers
- Secure and monitored communication channels

### Data Loader Components
The Data Loader system provides robust and flexible data ingestion capabilities, essential for building the agent's knowledge base:
- Support for multiple data sources (PDF, DOCX, Excel, JSON, Web, YouTube)
- Real-time data streaming and processing
- Intelligent chunking and preprocessing
- Automated metadata extraction
- Integration with MongoDB's vector storage

### Tool Integration and Extensibility

The framework's tool integration system provides a flexible interface for incorporating external capabilities. This system allows agents to:
1. Seamlessly connect with external APIs and services
2. Execute specialized functions based on context
3. Perform direct database operations with MongoDB
4. Integrate custom tools through a standardized interface

### Orchestration and Control

At the orchestration level, the framework provides sophisticated control mechanisms for managing complex agent interactions. The system handles resource allocation, monitors task execution, and maintains error recovery protocols. This orchestration layer ensures that multiple agents can work together effectively, sharing resources and information while maintaining system stability.
    - **Resource Management**: Efficiently allocating computational resources
    - **Agent Collaboration**: Enabling multiple agents to work together
    - **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery and exception management

## Environment Requirements
The agentic framework requires the following configurations:
- Node Version: **v20.0+**
- MongoDB Version (Atlas): **v7.0 (M10 Cluster Tier)**
- Recommended RAM: **8GB minimum**

## Document Preface
The MAAP Agentic Framework documentation provides comprehensive guidance for building intelligent agent-based applications using MongoDB's capabilities. This framework extends beyond traditional RAG applications by incorporating sophisticated agent architectures that can perform complex reasoning, maintain persistent memory, and execute multi-step tasks.

The framework is designed to be highly modular and configurable, allowing developers to:
1. Define custom agent behaviors and capabilities
2. Implement specialized memory systems
3. Integrate external tools and APIs
4. Orchestrate multiple agents for complex tasks
5. Leverage MongoDB for efficient data operations and memory management

The setup process involves:
1. Installing the framework and its dependencies
2. Configuring agent types and behaviors
3. Setting up memory systems
4. Integrating necessary tools and APIs
5. Implementing custom agent logic

Configuration is managed through YAML files, similar to the RAG framework, but with additional parameters for agent-specific features such as memory management, tool usage, and agent coordination.
