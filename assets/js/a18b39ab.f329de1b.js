These records represent real-world scenarios such as payments, savings, and expenses, making the dataset highly relevant for building an intelligent finance assistant. To generate the vector embeddings for storing and retrieving this data, we will use the Granite Embedding Models (ibm-granite/granite-embedding-125m-english) from IBM Watsonx.ai. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of financial data, enabling efficient similarity searches and contextual data retrieval. In addition to embedding models, Watsonx.ai also provides large language models (LLMs) for conversational chat query and retrieval capabilities, in our use case we are using Granite 3.0 (ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct) model, which are integral to this tutorial.
